# rock-paper-scissors
## Part of the Odin Project Curriculum
This is my first project that brings together HTML, Javascript, and CSS. 
So far, the game looks and acts very basic, but I've added some cool features and will continue to add more.

## First stage | Game in the browser console
The benefits I got from this stage:
- Learned how to write functions and learned how to make them interact with each other

## Second stage | Game with UI
The benefits I got from this stage:
- Deepened understanding of Flexbox
- Learned how to update DOM with Javascript
